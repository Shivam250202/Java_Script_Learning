## About This Repository

This repo serves as a personal log of my progress and a collection of my practice code. I started this to keep track of what I'm learning and to have a centralized place for all my JavaScript experiments.

## What I'm Learning ðŸ“š

I am currently focusing on the following areas:

* **Core Concepts:** Variables, data types, operators, and control flow.
* **Functions:** Declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and scope.
* **Arrays and Objects:** Methods, iteration, and data manipulation.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Interacting with web pages, handling events, and creating dynamic content.
* **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`.
